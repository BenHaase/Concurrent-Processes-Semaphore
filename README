Assignment 2

To make both master and slave executable file use
	make

make clean will remove all .o files and the cstest file created
by running the program as well as the library file

To run the program use
	./master
or
	./master -t x
The -t option specifies the time limit on the program, where x should be
an integer value and represents time in seconds. If not specified the
default time used will be 300 seconds (5min). On time out the master process
will kill all slave processes, clean up shared memory and semaphores, and exit.

ctrl c (^C) signal will be intercepted by the master process who then
terminates the slave processes, cleans up shared memory, and exits.

The file which the slave processes write to is called "cstest" and
will be opened in append mode.

Description:
The master process spawns 19 slave processes who exec "slave" and
compete for a shared resource. The master process sets up shared
memory to hold semaphores and counts for the processes. 
Upon the reciept of (^C) or a time out
all processes terminate. Slave processes will print messages to stderr
on: entry to CS, exit from the CS, waiting and acquiring semaphores, upon performing
3 writes to the shared file before terminating, time out event, and (^C).
The semaphore sem is used as a buffer in an attempt to keep one process from entering
the critical section multiple times in a row.  Mutex guards entry to the critical section.
